# local storage

local storage pertains to the topic of te carriculumn today because we have been building sites revolving around user input
with user input comes local storage so that a user can leave where they left off and back button to a page that doesnt seem as if though it completley reset itself to ground zero.

## Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

- so that they could store the state of the interface, if user input is causing     the page to change you dont want to lose all progress generated.
- to restore Search data like on google.
- to store html form elements while in progress

## What information should not be stored in local storage?
user names and addresses and things for security purposes can be used maliciously
## Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

strings can only be stored in local data. you can work around this by using JSON.stringify() and Json.parse() Methods

## Things I want to know more about

removing local data and more encompassing things that local data can be stored for, i always enjoy seeing how these concepts are used in a real life application or website that we use every day even thoguh i understand much of that is proprietary
