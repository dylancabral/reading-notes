# Ethics in Tech

## The Code I still ashamed of

Some companys will ask you to do unethical things, the requirements can sometimes be wrong

you can be clouded when at work into doing things for the sake of the company

as developers we are one of the last lines of defense against a possibly unethical product release

this spoke to me because i have in my past work experience become ingrained in the system, become shrouded from what i am actually doing because its just a job, also parhmaceutical companies are one of my biggest icks so im sad that this happpenee but glad that it changed the writers perspective and i agree this is unethical

## Project dragonfly

being morale as a developer can have emmence effect , googles developers resigning for fear of the unethical thing they were building casued googl to not renew the contract for project dragon fly

> The decision also seems at odds with Google’s once-prominent motto “Don’t be evil” and it clashes with the principles the company adopted in June after the Pentagon contract controversy, in which Pichai promised that the company would not to use artificial intelligence to develop technology “whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.”

> Google employees say these kinds of promises are no longer enough, in light of the news about the censorship tool, and they are demanding a more formal role in decisions about the ethical implications of their work.

Employees are the ones who literally create value for shareholders, so they need to be on board with what they are creating.

I really enjoy the sentement about the value in the company being the people who create the products, censoring information is inately wrong in my opinion and especially in the vision of china i agree with the employees and am happy they faught for this 

## Amazon workers demand censored search engine

> Our company should not be in the surveillance business; we should not be in the policing business; we should not be in the business of supporting those who monitor and oppress marginalized populations,” the employee letter states.

it is getting more frequent that employees speak up against projects they find unethical even though it is yet to see the impacts at a amazon

It is the duty of the creators of a product to question it. it is really wonderful seeing people fight the products that they deam wrong and even if i dont necisssarily agree with this specific instance im sure the developers on project know more and feel more strongly about it.

## amazon demand cancel recognition

> Employees at the company have spent months protesting Google’s involvement in Project Maven, sending a letter to Pichai demanding that Google terminate its contract with the Department of Defense. Several employees even resigned in protest, concerned that Google was aiding the development of autonomous weapons systems.

> The AI principles represent a reversal for Google, which initially defended its involvement in Project Maven by noting that the project relied on open-source software that was not being used for explicitly offensive purposes.

AI is a reqally interesting thing and i dont know that i disagree with its use in this situation i can understand the fear of unethical uses but i think that some jobs arent meant to way on certain humans morality. but again happy for workers to stand against things they feel are unethical 

## big data is our civil rights issue

> Data doesn’t invade people’s lives. Lack of control over how it’s used does.

> You decide what data is about the moment you define its schema.

Data analyzation can in many ways just boil down to stereotyping 

Now run this backwards. If I know you like these things, or see you mention them in blog posts, on Facebook, or in tweets, then there’s a good chance I know your gender and your race, and maybe even your religion and your sexual orientation. And that I can personalize my marketing efforts towards you.

That makes it a civil rights issue.

Its interesting to think about the most useful tool being so unethical, learning about data structures is the ultimate tool to information but it also is startling how thoughtful you have to be to use it in an enthical manner. I hope that witht his data we can lean more towards doing good but i understand that data makes money and im not entirely hopeful
