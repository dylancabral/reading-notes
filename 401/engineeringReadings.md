# Engineering Reading Assignment

## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I bring an attitude and enthusiasm for life that i think noone can match, I am so excited by the ups and downs of life, evey moment makes me a better and more learned person and I think that in a word of hard technical skills being able to bring community and a postive attitude for both struggle and triumph is something that truly noeone can bring in the way that i can, i know that programmers are just people and I am A big fan of people, forming positice relationships and building report with your teamates is like making everyone your coach, I look forward to changing the micro level of what ever section of the industry i can wiggle my way into.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

turning my down time into a productive endevour, thinking of relaxing as mental recovery can bring me a magnitude farther in how i adress the work that is presented to me after a small break or a weekend, this is a hard endevour and all my time is worth millions if i can use it tto the best of my ability, I need to interact in the worl intentionally and hopefully i will learn faster and struggle more and learn quicker and grow faster

Understand that focus and being busy are not the same thing, if you are desciplined with your time you can make 1 hr feel like 3, i think thats one of the things i enjoy most about this field is you are paid to do and fix and grow not hangout for 8 hrs.

Understand there is a solution to almost every problem, understadnding that the only thing i know is nothing can allow me to continue to search for answers and growth

Be curios, being stumped is an opportunity for growth not a punch in the gut, it is the spark from the first sip of cofee, its showing you it is time to start the engine

PLan more, Divide, break things into small steps, game the system so that it feels like you are winning on a micro level and that will result in theat macro success

## Things I Want Know More About

 How to make practicing code more fun, how to feel as if my free time i want to dive farther and farther into these topics rather than being burnt out on them, nootropics, meditation, blue light glasses, i just want to know how to have more stamina, and how to keep the brain locked in for 10-12 hours a day especially when being involved in an intense program like this.
