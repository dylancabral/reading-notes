# Data Structure Reading

Data Structuring seems like the entire call to python, it is a way of archiving emmence ammounts of information and we are perfecting how to search through that data and return it to the user

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

1. Linked Lists contains a value and a pointer

    this is really good at adding nodes ansd deleting but it is not good at retreaving nodes

2. Array continues block of cells inthe     computers memory

    arrays are really good at retrieving items but can be taxing on memory

3. Hash table uses a marker to retrieve a marker

    these memorie locations can be wherever as long as they are marked, you can have collisiions but hash table is great at retieving and adding

4. stack and the queue  

    Last in first out

    First in First Out

    limited use

5. Graphs and trees

    graph is a klinked list but the pointers are called edges but can have numbers and weights assignes to them, use these to represent family trees, or a binary search tree for searching really effieciently

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

Base case makes sure the recursion has a failsafe therefore it will run but will end if it reaches the failsafe
