# Testing and Modules

This pertains to todays learninf becasue testing is going to be present in all of our labs past this point, testing encourages us to write clean code as well as verifies that the code we have written is doing what we ask of it, recursion is a way of moving through a function and is one of the main manners in which we will be handling input and output in this course, it can be some of the cleanest and best looking code but has its draw backs as well

## TDD

> Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

It is is important to write tests as the same name as your function with test_ before so you know its sibling function

we also want to seperate tests from the module

## AAA

Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);

Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);

Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

The cycle is made by three steps:

ðŸ†˜ Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isnâ€™t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
âœ… Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
ðŸ”µ Refactor the code â€” the first version doesnâ€™t need to be the beautiful one (donâ€™t be shy)

testing incourages you to understand the entire spectrum of the code, input output, reusability

it will also verify that pending the test changed code is still in working order

## dunder name == dunder main

we are working to write clean reusable code, using this allows the program to filter out the modules from the main head and can ensure that things work when ran as they will run standalone

## how does recursion work

recursion is the fact of eveything calling on the previous situation, it all changes considering what is found before its a bunch of functions runnning in insane speed diving down to the bottom

## Things I want to know more about

Recursion, is it worth it to use as it can overload memory it seems with it being so reliant on all previous iterations

I just want to see more python code written, it is confusing, i dont understand the syntax yet and im feeling ill equipped
