# **What is a text editor?**
> "A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site."


## How should a developer or aspiring developer chose their text editor


>"I think the best text editor is
truly the one that you enjoy using the most"

## Text editors impliment tools that allow a developer to simplify workflow
  These tools can be bery helpful in speeding up your creation of code
  >"A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code
completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos."\


Another example of these tools is called Syntax highlighting
>"syntax
highlighting. Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text"

## Why do people decide to use other text editors than the Native operations sytem one like *Notepad* or *Text Edit*?
> "I think you’ll find that when using the text editors that come on your
computer, that there are no special bells or whistles at all. I think
you’ll find that there is no code completion. But what that means is
your text editor won’t assist you in finding your mistakes. You’ll have
to discover them on your own."
