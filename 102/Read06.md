# Intro to Javescript

- You can use any text editor to build javascript
- **java** and **javescript** are differnet programming languages that use entirely differnt syntax
- you caa embed or include javascript directly into the html file much like css to html but it is not recoomended

## Ways to use java script

the `alert` function.
> the alert function would display text to the user on the web page.
---
`document.write` 
>would output text as well but this is used to change the content of the page.
---
`console.log`
> displays information to yourself or other developers in the console.
`prompt`
> this is will display a pop up window where a user will interact and that varaible will effect the outcome of the webpage.
`confirm`
similar to promt but this will display a yes or no question so that less varaiblles will effect the outcome.

## What are variables

>Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

## When to Use JavaScript var?

Always declare JavaScript variables with `var`,`let`, or`const`.

The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The `let` and `const` keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use `var`.

## When to Use JavaScript const?

If you want a general rule: always declare variables with `const`.

If you think the value of the variable can change, use `let`.

> variables hold values, they are used in expressions to change outcomes and enable the webpage to change with givin iput

## JavaScript Identifiers

**All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.**

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

---
Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter.
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
