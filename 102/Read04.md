## What is HTML

>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content

## How do you use HTML to display content?

Rather than in markdown how the symbols attatched to a word will style and affect the content html is a structure specific for what is in a page, while you can styalize in html it is best to just to build the structure of the house, In html you use opening in closing tags to identify wat type of content is being displayed within strict boundaries so that you can styalize this content in other programs.

> `my cat is very grumpy`

would be structured in paragraph form as

> `<p>my cat is very grumpy</p>`

using the *element* or what we call tags

> `<p> Content </p>`

You can display the beginning and end of where you can place rules on the content

elements can also have atributes, these can be used to identify more variables so that you have more surface area for rules and styling applied to the element

> `<p class="editor-note>my cat is very grumpy</p>`
---
> `class=editor-note` within the `<p>`being the attribute, being broken down into two markers
---
>`class` being the name or identifier and
`editor-note` being the value or what is applied

## What can you do in HTML?

empty elements can be used to imbed images into your webpage

>`<img src='images/firefox-icon.png' alt ="My test image" />`

this would display an image where this empty element was written
