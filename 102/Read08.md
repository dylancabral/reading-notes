| Name	                         | Shorthand  |	Meaning
|:------------------------------:|:-----------:|:------------------:|
| Assignment                     | `x = f()`   |`	x = f()  `      |
| Addition assignment            |`	x += f()`  |`	x = x + f() `   |
| Subtraction assignment         |`	x -= f() ` |`	x = x - f()`    |
| Multiplication assignment      |`	x *= f()  `|`	x = x * f() `   |
| Division assignment            |`	x /= f() ` |`	x = x / f() `   |
| Remainder assignment           |`	x %= f() ` |`	x = x % f() `   |
| Exponentiation assignment      |`	x **= f()` |`	x = x ** f()`   |
| Left shift assignment          |`	x <<= f()` |`	x = x << f() `  |
| Right shift assignment         |`	x >>= f()` |`	x = x >> f()`   |
| Unsigned right shift assignment|`	x >>>= f()`|`	x = x >>> f()`  |
| Bitwise AND assignment         |`	x &= f()  `|`	x = x & f()`    |
| Bitwise XOR assignment         |`	x ^= f()  `|`	x = x ^ f() `   |
| Bitwise OR assignment          |`	x = f()   `|`	x = x | f()`    |
| Logical AND assignment         |`	x &&= f() `|`	x && (x = f())` |
| Logical OR assignment          |`	x ||= f() `|`	x || (x = f()) `|
| Logical nullish assignment     |`	x ??= f() `|`	x ?? (x = f())` |
