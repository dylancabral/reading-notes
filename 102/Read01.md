---
In todays reading, just like any new coding language there are basic rules and best practices, there is things that you **HAVE** to get right, and other things that just make the readability and interactability of your code better we are gonna go over some of the stuff that I Learned.

## The *Does* of MD Syntax

- ### Do Put spaces before and after a heading 
- ### when using a **#** in a header it is important to put a space inbewteen the symbol and the word so that your practices fit in multiple platforms
- ### unlike html you shouldn't indent at the beginning of a paragrah. MD reads this differently and may show a formatting issue with your left aligned text being out and about 
- ### While you can **double space** after a line to create a line break it is easier for others to see what is going on in your work with a **< br >** tag like in html
- ### underscores are interechangable in most senses with the * but when making text bold or italic in the middle of a string its best to use the * symbol as it is more compatible 
- ### Use a **.** when doing a list that you intend to print in sequence, not all markdown applications agree with the (parenthesis)

# In programing, situations are  mostly absulute.
>it is important to know that structure and using the correct syntax is the only way to get your code to work, code is a human way of communicating with something that doesnt think like us. you need to follow the words in order for the robot to do what you want. :technologist:

# FUN FACT
I also very much enjoyed that in git hub you can add some flare in just like we would when chatting with your friends
