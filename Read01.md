## The *Does* of MD Syntax

- ### Do Put spaces before and after a heading 
- ### when using a # in a header it is important to put a space inbewteen the symbol and the word so that your practices fit in multiple platforms*
- ### unlike html you shouldn't indent at the beginning of a paragrah. MD reads this differently and may show a formatting issue with your left aligned text being out and about 
- ### While you can double space after a line to create a line break it is easier for others to see what is going on in your work with a *< br >* tag like in html*
- ### underscores are interechangable in most senses with * but when making text bold or italic in the middle of a string its best to use the * symbol as it is more compatible 
- ### Use a .when doing a list that you intend to print in sequence, not all markdown applications agree with the ()
