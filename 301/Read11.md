# MongoDB and Mongoose
## **sql**
- relational db
- table based db
- represent data in form of tables which consist of N number of rows
- vertically scallable 
- scaled by increasing horsepower of hardware



## **no sql**
- non-relational or distributed database
- documents based, key value pairs grap or wide column stores which do not have standard schema
- dynamic schema 
- horizontally scalable 
- scalable by increasing the database servers in the pool to reduce load

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data

## Which type of database is best for scalability?
