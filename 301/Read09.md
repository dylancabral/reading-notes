## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
If it returns the same result if it is given the same argument


## What are the benefits of a pure function?
The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts


## What is immutability?
when a state is unchangeable after it is created

## What is Referential transparency?
if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

## What is a module?
its a seperation of functionality into smaller sections

## What does the word ‘require’ do?
creates a path to another module

## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
module.exports = ();

## What do we have to do to make a module available?
set a variable equal to what is required(sent into the new module)
